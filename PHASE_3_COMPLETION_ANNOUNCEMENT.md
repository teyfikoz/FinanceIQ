## 🚀 What's New in v1.7?

We're excited to announce the completion of **Phase 3: Institutional Intelligence** - three powerful modules that give you Bloomberg-level insights into what hedge funds, whale investors, and institutional players are doing RIGHT NOW.

---

## ✨ New Modules (Phase 3)

### 1. 📈 Whale Momentum Tracker
**Track institutional consensus in real-time**

**What it does:**
- Calculates **Institutional Consensus Indicator** (0-100 score)
- Detects **Consensus Buys** (3+ whales buying the same stock)
- Detects **Consensus Sells** (3+ whales selling the same stock)
- Identifies **Divergences** (whale conflicts - who's right?)
- Ranks stocks by **Momentum Score**

**Key Metrics:**
- **Momentum Score Formula:** `(Net Buy % + Overlap × Confidence) / 2`
- **Consensus Threshold:** 3+ whales
- **Signal Strength:** STRONG (5+ whales), MODERATE (3-4 whales)

**Example Output:**
```
Consensus Score: 51.3/100 (NEUTRAL market)
46 Consensus Buys detected (KO: 13 whales buying!)
42 Consensus Sells detected (AAPL: 16 whales selling!)
41 Divergences detected (whale conflicts)
8 AI insights generated
```

**Use Cases:**
- "Which stocks are whale investors buying RIGHT NOW?"
- "Is there consensus on AAPL or are whales divided?"
- "Show me the top 10 stocks by institutional momentum"

**Code:** 1,060 lines (480 core + 450 UI + 130 insights)

---

### 2. 🔗 ETF-Whale Linkage
**Understand your passive vs active exposure**

**What it does:**
- Analyzes **overlap between ETFs and whale portfolios**
- Calculates **Passive/Active ratio** for your portfolio
- Classifies your investment style (Passive-Heavy, Active-Heavy, Balanced)
- Shows which whales align with which ETFs
- Detects **ETF concentration** (HIGH/MODERATE)

**Major ETFs Covered:**
- QQQ (Invesco QQQ - Tech)
- SPY (SPDR S&P 500 - Large Cap)
- VOO (Vanguard S&P 500)
- ARKK (ARK Innovation)
- XLF (Financial Select)
- XLE (Energy Select)
- XLK (Technology Select)
- XLV (Health Care Select)
- IWM (Russell 2000)
- VTI (Total Market)

**Investment Style Classification:**
- **Passive-Heavy:** >60% of your holdings overlap with major ETFs
- **Active-Heavy:** >60% of your holdings are whale picks NOT in ETFs
- **Balanced:** 40-60% each

**Example Output:**
```
Your Portfolio: Balanced (45% Passive, 55% Active)
Passive Stocks: 12 holdings ($45K) - SPY, QQQ overlap
Active Stocks: 8 holdings ($55K) - Whale picks only
Top Overlap: Buffett's portfolio 68% aligns with SPY
```

**Use Cases:**
- "Am I a passive or active investor?"
- "Which whale's strategy is closest to QQQ?"
- "How much of Buffett's portfolio overlaps with SPY?"
- "Should I rebalance toward passive or active?"

**Code:** 600 lines (400 core + 200 UI)

### 3. 📡 Hedge Fund Activity Radar
**Multi-source institutional activity tracking**

**What it does:**
- Tracks hedge fund activity from **4 data sources:**
  1. **13F Filings** (quarterly institutional moves)
  2. **Short Interest** (FINRA data - bearish positioning)
  3. **Put/Call Ratio** (options sentiment)
  4. **Insider Transactions** (SEC Form 4 - corporate confidence)
- Calculates **Composite Activity Score:** -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish)
- Detects **Unusual Activity** (>2.5σ anomalies)
- Generates **Market Activity Index** (0-100 scale)
- Creates **Time × Ticker heatmap** (30-day activity trends)
- Analyzes **TEFAS flow correlation**

**Activity Score Breakdown:**
- **13F Score:** Net buyers vs sellers (40% weight)
- **Short Score:** Short interest changes (30% weight)
- **Options Score:** Put/Call ratio (20% weight)
- **Insider Score:** Insider buys vs sells (10% weight)

**Signal Classification:**
- **STRONG_BULLISH:** >50 (hedge funds aggressively buying)
- **BULLISH:** 20-50 (moderate buying)
- **NEUTRAL:** -20 to +20 (mixed signals)
- **BEARISH:** -50 to -20 (moderate selling)
- **STRONG_BEARISH:** <-50 (hedge funds aggressively selling)

**Example Output:**
```
Market Activity Index: 51.1/100 (NEUTRAL)
AAPL: Activity Score +43.6 (BULLISH)
  - 13F: +24.0 (8 buyers, 2 sellers)
  - Short: -1.7 (slight increase)
  - Options: -3.5 (neutral put/call)
  - Insider: -15.0 (insiders selling)

Unusual Activity Detected:
🚨 TSLA - SHORT_SPIKE (z=3.2σ)
   Short interest increased 25% in 2 weeks

🚨 NVDA - PUT_CALL_ANOMALY (z=2.8σ)
   Put/Call ratio at 2.1 (hedging/bearish bets)
```

**Use Cases:**
- "Where are hedge funds positioning RIGHT NOW?"
- "Is there unusual short interest in TSLA?"
- "What's the composite institutional sentiment on AAPL?"
- "Show me anomalies - where are hedge funds making big moves?"
- "Is the market risk-on or risk-off?"

**Code:** 1,250 lines (500 core + 350 UI + 400 tests)
